27/04/2021, 23:13 - +91 74003 26338: Yes so longer the chain closer to the +ve electrode right?
27/04/2021, 23:13 - Waqar Mirza: Then it would be the one closest to positive electrode

27/04/2021, 23:15 - Waqar Mirza: No coz longer chain will be inhibited more by the medium right?
27/04/2021, 23:16 - +91 74003 26338: But don‚Äôt higher charges have greater mobility?
27/04/2021, 23:16 - Hastyn Doshi: Shorter chains is smaller so moves farther
Since DNA is negatively charged the shorter one will be closest to +ve electrode

28/04/2021, 00:30 - +91 98205 54698: Location decided by ends of gene you wanna multiply. Length between 18-28 nucleotides. It should have low GC content.
28/04/2021, 00:31 - Waqar Mirza: I think it was said 50-60 percent GC in slides?
28/04/2021, 00:31 - +91 98205 54698: Thats the way restriction enzyme identifies where to cut.

28/04/2021, 08:30 - +91 96994 88605: 1/16 ig
28/04/2021, 08:30 - +91 96994 88605: Probability of O is 1/4 and probqbility of disease is 1/4
28/04/2021, 08:32 - Dhruv Rambhia: The answer is right. But why is probability of disease 1/4?
28/04/2021, 08:32 - +91 96994 88605: It's a recessive disease, and both parents are normal which means they are both carriers
28/04/2021, 08:33 - +91 99884 41196: Won't it mean that the prob of disease is 100%?
28/04/2021, 08:33 - +91 99884 41196: Provided O blood group comes?
28/04/2021, 08:33 - Dhruv Rambhia: So are we assuming it is an X-linked disease?
28/04/2021, 08:33 - Dhruv Rambhia: Exactly what I feel
28/04/2021, 08:33 - +91 96994 88605: Blood group and disease are independently inherited

28/04/2021, 08:35 - Dhruv Rambhia: Why are they independently inherited? The gene which is responsible for disease is present on the same chromosome which determines O blood type
28/04/2021, 08:35 - +91 96994 88605: No it's not
28/04/2021, 08:36 - +91 96994 88605: It could be something like disease causing gene is on some other chromosome, and chromosomes having genes for A and B have something that can combat the disease

28/04/2021, 10:32 - +91 93739 47583: I think RT PCR is for converting RNA to DNA
28/04/2021, 10:33 - +91 93739 47583: And yeah also for making several copies of a gene by using primers
28/04/2021, 10:33 - +91 98205 54698: It only makes copies.

28/04/2021, 12:29 - +91 93739 47583: It's pluripotent meaning it can make many but not all types of cells

28/04/2021, 14:38 - Parth Dwivedi: Agar 5' - 3' likhenge toh ulta nhi karna padega na?

28/04/2021, 14:39 - +91 93739 47583: Matlab ulta karna hi padega
