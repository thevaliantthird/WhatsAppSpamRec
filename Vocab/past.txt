 Can be done like this (i hope). Take a basis of the col space say x_1,x_2...x_k the  the col space becomes Ex_1...Ex_k. Since E is invertible the new col space is also a basis. And conversely if Ex_1...Ex_r is a basis then x_1...x_r is a basis

Here if m-r=1,then as the first r rows are non zero linearly independent and r+1 th is zero row.  Then r+1 th row will also can not be written as linear combination of first r rows. Then why last one is not linearly independent
 The r+1th row can be writte  as a linear combination of the first r rows
 Thats how it became zero
 Yes
But now r+1 row is zero row so if u write r+1'row as a linear combination of first r rows then
Isn't is is same as saying first r rows as linearly dependent
 *0* is always a linear combination of any set of vectors
 How?
 Taking coefficients as 0
 just make coefficient 0
 But then for linearly dependent we must have atleast one nonzero coefficient
 no you're mixing stuff up
 this always works
 for linearly dependent, you have other possibilities as well
 but that is immaterial

 Is my *written* solution *right*?
 well technically you've only shown that *your* algorithm will require n steps for A = O
 I have to also show that it cannot be done in less than n for A=O
 yes
 Which is elementary
 in fact, you can actually show that for a general A, you can't do with fewer than
n - rank(A) moves
 If you use less than n steps by PHP atleast one row that is O
 correct
 That is similarly elementary
 Atleast one column remains a linear combination of others
 or well actually, you could've done the changes in the 'r' linearly independent columns as well
 <Media omitted>
How to prove this statement
 use the definition of linearly (in)dependence
 Oh..yeah got itð 
 *ð
 Well I've reduced it to proving rank(A+B)<=rank(A)+rank(B)
 But before proceeding is this statement true?
 in fact, the union is a subspace iff one of them is contained in the other
 also, notice the _range space_ of a matrix A â â^{m Ã n} defined as

R(A) â {Ax : x â ââ¿} is a subspace of âáµ

Moreover, dim(R(A)) = rank(A)
 with the above two observations, your inequality should be simple to derive
 ð 
 It wasn't intentional
Believe me
 â is used when the intersection is known to be *{0}*
 possibly useful intermediate result:
given two subspaces U, W â ââ¿, the intersection U â© W is always a subspace but the union U âª W need not be a subspace but the following is:

U + W â {u + w : u â U and w â W}

The above is the smallest subspace of ââ¿ containing both the subspaces U and W.

Moroever, dim(U + W) = dim(U) + dim(W) - dim(U â© W).
 rewriting again so that fewer people see the wrong notation
 What are all the conditions for a set to be a basis
 Linearly independent and span is the subspace
 And the cardinality one ?
 Just linearly independent and max cardinality among all linearly independent subsets of the subspace
 the ones with cardinality only apply for ââ¿ btw (later in the course you will see some infinite dimensional spaces where it won't be true)
 Okay thanks both

 Does the statement S spans V, imply that S only spans V....or that V is a subset of Span(S)?
 I don't think it matters, because in the second case, V wouldn't be a subspace in the first place...
 Why
 Does i, j, k span x-y plane??
 i hat, j hat, k hat that is
 Oh, yes sorry ð¤¦ð¾ââï¸
 Now though, I don't think second would be true, because then i j k would be a basis for xy plane
 Which seems odd
 Since span + linearly independent implies basis
 Though, I think it shpuld be the first one since we defined S spans V as span S = V
 I was getting unnecessarily literalð
 Yup fiest statement is true but second may get corrected as it can also be called subset of spanV ig proper subset i.e. or some other name for it
 Both are true
 Can it be proper subset?
 It can be, but the component of k would be 0
 Thats all
 iirc, R^2 is a subspace inside R^3
 So nothing wrong with that
 It'll unnecessarily disturb our definitions, we define basis for a subspace as a subset of that subspace
 heh, when defining span S, the underlying assumption is that S â V
 and what you raise is a good point
often, in proofs, if you have a set B â V and a subspace W â V, in order to show that B is a basis for W, you must also show that B â W
 Ah! That makes sense
 This automatically guarantees that V cannot be a subset of span S right ?
 Yes ig
 it guarantees that span S has to be a subset of V
 what you're saying is not tru
 e
 He means proper subset ig
 Yeah I mean proper subset
 How are we using this fact before proving it

Why any row  vector of A is a linear combn of only those r vectors. It should be linear combn of all the row vectors na?
 row rank = r
 and that is an assumption
 If I have a set of r column vectors which are linearly independent then can I add a non zero  column vector C with its coefficient zero and say the new set is linearly independent?
 Why
 Check the definition for linear independence
 The *only* solution to the linear combination being 0 should be all coefficients being 0
 what do you mean "add a column vector with coefficient zero"
 ++
 I think she meant in the new linear combination she makes the coefficient of the added column 0
 Yeah
 But u r just using the fact that all variables as 0 always solves a homogeneous equation
 U need to prove it's only solution possible
 We donât *create* linear independence, we just check for it I guess
 Then the set will be linearly independent
 Yes
 you talk about linear independence of a set
 not of an equation
 Important tip ??
 Then how in that proof we say that rank was greater than r
 @919886135500
 so where do you have problem
 BTW in the rows of a submatrix we have only some elements of the corresponding rows of the matrix.
So how does the LI of rows in the submatrix imply the LI of the rows of the matrix?
 Since if the 'extentded rows' of original matrix were Linearly dependent,then so wud be the rows of submatrix
 Because if the rows of the matrix were linearly dependant then the rows of the submatrix would be linearly dependant as well.
 Right

How to approach this?
 not sure if doable with stuff you know, except for just inspection/brute-force
 Observation 6.5-2.5=4
 I recall someone doing it via inspection by noting that 6.25 = 2.5Â² + 0.5Â²
 Yeah..I made that but how to relate it to actually getting the ans?
 EROs and ECOs might help
 Yeah..then right now we can only guess the matrix?
 Do eros in premultiplication and ecos in post
 Similar to how we find inverse of matrix by eros
 Ecos?
That could be type 1 only na?
 Type 2 and 3 won't be there
 You can do ecos AB= I in B
 Try proving this by taking transpose
 Why
 Ecos in B will be equivalent to eros in B_transpose
 can you write this out? I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to do
 (EA^T)^T = AE^T
 E is elementary
 I was thinking it as Ax=B
My bad
 Self respect ?
 okay... but I'm still not understanding how you'll calculate a square root of A with that
 Its just an insight what might help because we see some symmetries in A
 What are u trying to convert A into with eros and ecos
 Lets see
 Plus won't there be multiple solutions
 yes
 Hm my bad
 Oo
 You could convert it to a diagonal matrix tho right
 The reasoning I used to conclude this is faulty
 And that could be done nicely later
 marks were given for any one
 yeah that's what I'd done
 convert to diagonal, take square root there, then convert back
 if B is a root, so is -B ð
 And so is the one with all combinations of +/- in diagonal entries
 But apart from that when we have a diagonal matrix is equal to the square of a matrix
 ~is the one~ are the ones
 for the diagonal one, yeah
 Is it going to give us only 8 solutions if all diagonal entries are not equal?
 not sure I'm interpreting it correctly but there are matrices with infinitely many square roots
 What do you mean by convert?
 find a P such that Pâ»Â¹AP is diagonal, say D
 it is simple to find a matrix C such that CÂ² = D
 This we can do in an organised manner by finding the eigenvectors right
 but then, A = PCÂ²Pâ»Â¹ = (PCPâ»Â¹)Â²
so taking B = PCPâ»Â¹ works
 But can we show that upto the three signs the diagonal solution for B is unique
 For B' I mean
 is it ?
 The transformed version of B
 the D is not unique btw
 He said only 8 solutions
 Oh
 D is also unique only up to permutation of the diagonals
 I also said "iirc"
 can confirm
 What is D
 okay let me check on old moodle
 Diag
 Can we in a simple way conclude only 8 solutions
 uh maybe show that the square root of a diagonal matrix must be diagonal, then for each diagonal you have exactly two choices (assuming non-zero)

        a.f();
        a.g();
        b.f();
        b.g();
}```
 Can someone tell why does a.f() and a.g() call functions of A and not B after a=b assignment is done?
 ++
 good question
 also what does the "delete" keyword do?
 It is the opposite of new. It frees the dynamically allocated memory pointed by some poiter.
 Pointer.*
 only variables get transferred
 Because a is still of class A right?
 A is a class with all methods virtual
B derives from A

ap is a pointer to A
bp is a pointer to B

After the 2 heap allocations by the new keyword:
ap stores address of an A instance
bp stores address of a B instance

ap->f() will call A::f()
bp->g() will call B::g()

Now the magic happens
After ap=bp, ap now stores address of a B instance (same as what bp stores). It can store this because ap is a pointer to A, and B derives from A.

a=b (Now this is simply an assignment operator. The data of B is copied into A, but a still is an A object).

Hence a.f() will call A::f()
ap->f() will call B::f()
 Notice at the end,

ap stores address of a B instance
bp stores the address of that same B instance

a is an A instance with some data
b is a B instance whose data has been copied to a
 Are ap and bp pointing to the same address? No right as they are independent?
 Yes they are pointing to the same address after the ap=bp line of code
 a and b reside on different addresses though
 so making changes using ap would affect bp also? like I edit one of the variables using ap and access using bp then the change would be reflected?
 Yes. The changes will happen on the same region of heap memory
 Let us say there were some extra variables in class B that were not present in class A. When we write a=b; that extra data is basically discarded, right?
 I'm assuming it's the same case as in when the variables are named differently in the two objects, no change happens wrt to those variables
 Try it and find out

 Ah, thanks!
 Not getting any output from these
 Wait, but since none of the classes have any data does this mean that the statement a=b; is technically doing nothing at all?
 On line 170 and haven't completed prog5.cpp...
 What data is copied? Like... Every common variable still has the same value. A=B ka faida kya hua?
 Main to bas 5-6 lines likh raha hu har programpe
 Bhai mere 8 line ke observation hain, wtf
 Just as an example, what have you written for prog1.cpp?
 Suppose A had data members num1
Suppose B had data members num2 (and num1 from the base class)

Suppose a had num1 =4
Suppose b had num1 = 2, num2 = 10

After
a=b
a will have num1 = 2
b will have num1 = 2, num2 = 10
 In your code kuch nahi hoga because no data members exist
 This is in prog10, wo tab dekhega hi
 Koi ek observation PM kar na @917060361446
 Hmm. Then what does this mean?
 Won't num1 be over-riden here too?
 A will declare member num1
B will declare member num2

B automatically has num1 and num2 as members

a=b will copy b's num1 to a's num1
 Suppose a had num1 =4
Suppose b had num1 = 2, num2 = 10
won't you also be overriding num1 ka variable?
 Or in your case,

A has member A::y
B has members A::y and B::y

a=b will copy b's A::y to a
 We are never overriding num1 because we do not declare it
 It is derived from base
 If you declare it even after derivation from base, then your declaration will override the derived member
 <Media omitted>
How did we get 210 as v after we did a=b
 The variables weren't even same\
 Doing B(200) calls the base constructor and sets the base x to 210
 Then a=b copies b's x(which is 210) to a's x
 Right right I didn't realise instantiating B also calls constructor of A
 B's y won't be copied to As y.

B's x will be copied to As x

B is guaranteed to have an x member even if you don't declare them, since it derives them

 Isn't there some Resolution order in C++?
 In prog7 the problem is bp is not assigned any object ryt?
 bp = new B(); needs to be done before
 Think about a similar problem

Suppose A has a function f


Suppose B and C derive from A
Both now have the function f from base

Suppose D derives from B and C

How is D d; d.f() resolved?
 What is there to resolve? It's only defined in A
 See the thing is in c++, B contains A data. C also contains A data.
When D derives from B and C, it has both B's parents functions and C's parents functions, even though the parent is same
 It isn't resolved. Gives error unless you write B::f() etc. But if while inheriting A we write ```virtual public``` then no problem, only 1 copy inherited
 Basically B has a function f
C also has a function f
(Both from parent)

So there is a clash when D derives from B and C
 Basically the best thing to do in such cases is try it out. The diamond inheritance problem is universal in OOP wherever multiple inheritance is allowed, but the resolution depends on the implementation, eg C++ resolves it differently than other languages
 What does writing virtual public do?
 Idk syntax ð¤·ð»ââï¸

while(!temp_boolean){

temp_boolean = f.eof();```
Now use print temp_boolean like we print normal variables such as n and count to get the value of f.eof() at that time (*assuming we have not moved file pointer before printing temp_boolean*)
 haa you can do that, you can set the temp_boolean on the watch stack

 What is the difference between dynamic binding and function overriding?
 I mean, till now , we have use dynamic binding only to override the functions, right?
 Dynamic binding is just same as runtime polymorphism I think
 Dynamic biding is the name given to the process where during runtime vtable is scanned for the deepest definition of the function
 The compiler while producing machine code *already* knows which function you intend to call, for normal function overloading, and will produce machine code for that only
 What's machine code
 For virtual functions, it will produce machine code to traverse the vtable and determine at runtime which function to be called, and then call that function
 But aint that called overloading
 ?
 Basically the code that you write is trash, as far as the cpu is concerned, it can't make any sense of it. It has to be converted to machine code to be executed by the cpu, and that is precisely what the compiler does
 Yes. That is the normal function overloading, or "compile time polymorphism"
 No dynamic binding
 So compile time polymorphism for virtual function is dynamic binding ?
 How to access machine code? And is it same as bytecode?
 Its overriding not overloading right? Oveoading is same identifier different signature
 And for non virtual its function overloading ?
 *overloading
 *Runtime time polymorphism
 No. For virtual functions we can't do compile time polymorphism, we can't figure out which functions to call at compile time.

That's why during runtime we traverse the vtable to find that out, and that is precisely what dynamic binding or runtime polymorphism is
 Same thing really, similar concepts
 So compile time polymorphism is that when you have finalised which function to call and dynamic binding is to finalize that function
 ?
 Same name different signature is overloading and the one concerned with inheritance is overriding
 To put it simply, compile time polymorphism is finalizing which function to call during compilation

Runtime polymorphism is finalizing which function to call during runtime
 *with virtual inheritance
 .
 You can do compile time polymorphic for normal function overrides, you have to resort to runtime polymorphism for calling virtual functions
 Specific difference between runtime and compile time ?
 I thought both were same
 Compile time: during production of your executable. You can call g++ main.cpp right now, and the process that results is the compilation, and during that process the executable is created, and all normal function overrides are finalized during the creation of this executable

Runtime: when you actually decide to run your executable by doing ./a.out
 Remember, compilation and runtime may not occur very close in time to each other, and may not even occur on the same machine
 Thank you so muchð¥º
 Example: when EA created fifa20.exe, they had to compile it using the compiler, on their computers. During that time all normal function overrides were determined by the compiler

Now you, after a year of release of fifa20, decide to actually install and run it on your computer. When you click fifa20.exe, that's the moment the runtime starts. During runtime your cpu will actually traverse the vtable to find which virtual function to call
 And specific utility for this distinction ? Like we could have already determined which function to call from vtable during compile time and then just execute it
 No, that's the point, you couldn't have
 Rather than deciding what to call during runtime
 The user may tell what type of object it is
 Because which virtual function to call depends on which kind of object pointer it actually is, which can even depend on which keys the user ie you presses
 Like deciding levels and hardness of game ?
 That way u would have to write lot of code if everything was static binding
 Ugh, but yeah
 The EA developer could never have anticipated which keys you will press a year later on, to determine which virtual function will be called
 Oh got it
 Its like player now decided which arena and level to play upon and that way the pointers are created and the respective virtual functions via runtime binding are decided ?
 Basically on a rough level, anything that can be determined solely be inspecting the code, can be determined by the compiler at compile time

Anything that depends on when the program actually runs, where it runs, the environment in which it runs, user input etc are properties which have to be determined at runtime
 That can be one of the uses, yes
 Makes sense to me now
 What was the solution to the problem when a child class is deriving from 2 parent classes and both of them have a function which the base wants to call?
 We'd discussed this here
 I think it would throw an error and you would need to use parent1::(or other ) to resolve it
 You mean child class wants to call right?
 Yeah
 so whenever virtual functions are used ,it is run time polymorphism ?
 Yes
 suppose class C publicly inherits class A and class B and both contain a function g.....class C does not contain function g ......then which g function will be executed when we call it using an object of class C?

 why it is printing like one extra number at last
 again, which virtual function will be called depends on what kind of address the pointer holds. the pointer itself can be of a parent abstract type, holding the address to a derived type
 This message was deleted
 That tends to give run time errors i
 How ?
 can you show me an example?
 oh wait nvm
 <Media omitted>
This is from one of my _private_ documents, but it has been tested
 that will give a segfault because the pointer is holding no address
 nothing to do with virtual or abstract classes
 Yeah and we cannot instantiate A
 We can make it point to B though as u have done
 Yes, but you can cast a B* to an A* and dereference it, yes
 So for that not to occurs always while calling upon a pointer we should have it instantiated or pointing towards an object ?
 Also here how both are same like in one we are typecasting and making by default a pointer of A
But in second last line we are making the function values copies from b and then executing it in A
 If p is a pointer to class C, and you call

p->member,

it will try to access the area of memory which p stores, which will probably be a garbage address, and the OS will detect that and stop the program and raise a segfault
 because foo is a virtual function
 <Media omitted>
Why does this print derived::f?...will b not be considered as an object of base class?
 Roughly, how it is decided which virtual function will be called:

it looks at the pointer, and sees what *address* it stores. If it stores an address to base class, it will call function to base class. if it stores address to derived class, it will call function to derived class

The pointer itself can be of type pointer to base
 How to use labelled continue and labelled break ?
 Yeah but not getting which is which here?
 type is a reference to base, which is different than being simply a variable of type base

If it had been nonsense(Base b),

then calling nonsense(d) would instantiate a new variable, by allocating some new memory for base type, copy over the contents of d into this new variable, and that will be the parameter

But since the signature is nonsense(Base& b)

No new memory is allocated. b just refers to that same area of memory of d, which is the address of a derived type object
 c++ has goto but it's like the sequel trilogy, officially there but as far as we're concerned, didn't happen
 b->foo() //"->" ka syntax kya hota hain? like with the dot and * operator kaise karte hain ham?
 When we assign a pointer of a derived class to a pointer of a base class, do the variables of the derived class also get copied?
 Oh so what role does the type of a pointer have- the size that it can point to ?
 Type of a pointer determines what functions/members is syntactically legal to access from that pointer
 you can even fool the compiler by force casting an integer pointer to a class A pointer, granted, accessing any members can give you a segfault
 on a lower level this is what happens

suppose you have declared

class A
{
int m1;
int m2;
};

and in a function you have the statement

a->m2 = 4; //a is of type pointer to A

The compiler needs to generate machine code for this. How to do this? The compiler will notice that a is of type pointer to A, and thus it knows that whatever address a points to, 4 bytes after that should be a->m1, so it will generate the kind of the following assembly code

mov (4)a, 4

which is basically assembly for move the value 4 into 4 bytes after the address stored by a


Once the binary code is created, and the executable is made, that's it. The cpu doesn't care what type what is, assembly language doesn't have any features called types or classes or members etc. all the assembly code says to the cpu is, go to a, go to 4 bytes after that, store 4 in there

So only at a higher level does the compiler need to know the types and such just to keep track of how to generate the assembly code
 Once the assembly code is generated, "types" and "classes" hold no meaning
 Yeah but when the pointer type let say A* doesnot have a particular member function, then it shows error even if it stores the address for an object of B which has that member func. Why so?
 Notice that if you do

int* n = new int;

A* a = (A*)n; //class A definition is per my above message

a->m2 = 4;

You can "trick" the compiler into compiling this, this is perfectly okay syntactically, even though it is not correct logically, since a doesn't hold an address to A

Of course you will run into *some* kind of error when you try to run this code, now it's your turn think and tell me what kind of error, and why
 Why is address of m1 4 bytes after where a is pointing to?
 Segmentation fault hi aayega ig ð
Ig its similar to

int a[3];
And we then by for loop assigned the values to a0,a1 and a2. Then let say the for loop also assigned the value to a[3] as I had written end conditions in a wrong way.... Then the compiler will pass it but run time error
 Yes! It should logically give a segmentation fault, because you are accessing some memory you are not supposed to access

Wierdly, when I ran it on my laptop, it doesn't give a segfault, that is probably because the operating system has pre allocated 4kb of memory on the heap to my program, and accessing that "illegal" part of memory is still legal according to my operating system, so it won't throw a segfault when I try to access it
 I just noticed one peculiarity though.
```cout << a << endl;
cout << ++a << endl;```
Here a moves ahead by 8 bytes in the address. This should not happen, right? It should move the size of int imo
 Stack smashing is thrown if you allocate on stack, and try to access beyond the allowed stack region, yeah
 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class A { // abstract class
  public:
  int m1;
  int m2;
};
int main () {
int* n = new int(2);

A* a = (A*)n; //class A definition is per my above message

a->m2 = 4;
cout<<a->m1;
} yeah. this worked
 Ohh thats why for array....
Did the above code written by you worked fine?
 It depends on your compiler and how many bytes it gives to an int
 Yes. Logically it is very dangerous and should never be written, but it ran fine simply because the OS had preallocated some memory so didn't realise it was illegal
 I just checked with ```sizeof(int)``` and size of int is 4
 Probably because the OS, while pre allocating 4kb for the heap, zeros out the heap
 If you did this after you already have some allocations and deallocations, basically after fragmenting the preallocated 4kb, you would probably get some garbage
 One question for today's exam, make an abstraction for clock and use it as a timer for the rest of the exam ð
 It's working as expected then. One wanted the space 4 bytes after the start of allocation which was done for n using new to hold value '4' and the space at the start of that allocated heap memory to store 0. Hence there is no abnormality here.
 <Media omitted>
 ðððð
 Don't worry if you don't get this stuff rn, all of this is part of your sem5 and you'll surely be exposed to a lot more lower level stuff then tl understand what's going on
 a is a pointer to type A which is 8 bytes (2 ints)

So as ++ is defined for that particular pointer, it moved it ahead by 8 bytes
 Is this right?
 Oh is a a pointer to type A? Then yes moving ahead by 8 bytes is expected
 Oh okay yeah I was getting confused due to type casting from int
 Has type-casting been discussed in class?
 The memory page allocation  algorithm right? Memory is allocated in pages of 4kb or 8kb
 IMG-20210429-WA0012.jpg (file attached)
labelled break kaise kaam karta hain?
 yeah! the OS hands out 4kb pages when needed, and then C++'s own memory managing code divide's it up and allocates memory on that page to you as you do new calls
 Ye syllabus ma nahi hai na?
 Ho toh bhi Cpp mai nahi hai
 IMG-20210429-WA0013.jpg (file attached)
interesting to see that new calls malloc internally
 Oh sad to see, I never liked malloc, new always sounded much nicer ð¥²
 why didn't you like malloc?
 But ig malloc is more powerful
 Btw where is this code? Inside g++ ?
 C++ doesn't have ```byte``` numeric type?
 isn't short 2 bytes?
 Accha, but the casting doesn't work like a typical typedef does it?
 bool *x;
int y;
x= new bool [y];
What exactly does this piece of code do... And how?
 what was the clarification??
 class A{};
class B{};

int main(){
A a;
B b, b1;
b1= b*a;
}
 Oh so * is not defined here for those b and a right?
 Second error comes in condition of if na? Something like if(a=b)...

 In shapes2.cpp, how do the shapes get drawn when we initialise?
 We never called the draw() function explicitly anywhere but still the shapes get drawn
 The constructor of Fl_Widget does that for you, since u have inherited from it
 Constructor of Fl_Widget calls draw of inherited function. So everytime I allocate memory on heap using new, the circle calls constructor of shape, which in turn calls constructor of Fl_Widget which finally calls draw(). But this draw should be the draw of Fl_Widget and not the draw we defined in bottom most class of hierarchy
 ```#include <FL/Fl.H>
#include <FL/Fl_Window.H>
#include <Fl/Fl_Widget.H>
#include <Fl/fl_draw.H>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

#define BOW_RADIUS 50
#define BOW_START_X 50
#define BOW_START_Y 100
#define BOW_ARC_MEASURE 45

using namespace std;

class MovingObject: public Fl_Widget{
    protected:
    double vx, vy; //velocities
    int x, y; //coordinates
    int w, h; //dimensions
    public:
    MovingObject(int x, int y, int w, int h, double vx, double vy) : Fl_Widget(x, y, w, h)
    {
        this->x = x; this->y = y;
        this->w = w; this->h = h;
    }
};

class Bow: public MovingObject
{
    public:
    Bow(int x, int y, int w, int h, double vx = 0, double vy = 0) : MovingObject(x, y, w, h, vx, vy){}
    void draw();
};

void Bow::draw()
{
    fl_pie(BOW_START_X, BOW_START_Y, 50, 80, -90, 90);
}

int main()
{
    Fl_Window *window = new Fl_Window(800, 600, "Game");
    MovingObject* b = new Bow(100, 100, 100, 100);
    window->end();
    window->show();

 Either throw an exception of some sort. Or keep an additional parameter by reference which is bool. Set it to false initially. The 12, 13, the 13th cycle will set it to true. Now make sure 12 calls 13 iff it is false. This way u r done

 Another thing that is commonly used is memory mapping

The device memory is "mapped" to some virtual memory addresses. Those virtual memory addresses actually do not correspond to any physical addresses (ie actual on RAM memory), but to the display device memory. That way our CPU can write to that memory using plain old mov instructions, but actually behind the scenes the hardware that is responsible for actually transfering data to on chip memory, will detect that memory as being mapped to the device, and will reroute the signals to the device
 Device cpu meaning, the processor that is present with your, say display device, and is responsible directly for sending electrical signals to the display device pixel to light them up

 Probably something like this

Stream reads 10. Returns 10. 
Stream reads 20. Returns 20. 
Stream reads 30. Returns 30.
Stream sees file has ended. Uh oh. Eof flag raised. Returns 30.
Loop sees eof flag raised, so ends

 You can think of it as saying that the vector has ints. But that's just an idea to have. To know more about it, read up on Templates in C++

Thx for the info
 Time limit exceeded?
 One tip: At initialisation of the vector itself, if you have a rough idea of the number of elements you'll be storing, then set the capacity of the vector to that number
 If you give enough capacity at the start itself, then many heap allocations and deallocations won't be required
 Using linked list won't solve the time problem ?
 Well, "you traverse across them" implies that that's the only way... so ð¤·ââï¸
 Technically using push_back() is faster than preallocating capacity to a vector...
 How can that be? If we exceed the current arrays capacity, doesn't it reallocate to a larger array?
 Btw is knowing the inner implementation and working of all such things actually reqd for CP?
 It uses move constructors instead of copy constructors. So for things like ```vector<string>```, ```push_back``` is faster
 I am trying to understand why loop variables leak out in python and came across this post: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-September/056677.html Can someone help me understand why this makes it faster. What does it have to do with namespace creation and access
 If the set has only one member then that means that answer is 0 because every difference is same the n m can be very large
 My solution was a bit complicated...
All +ve differences and -ve differences (between consecutive terms) must be equal otherwise return -1 (no fixed value of c)
If the difference is of only one type (say +ve) and all differences are equal (between consecutive terms) then we get an AP and m can take any value, else return -1
If the difference between any 2 consecutive terms is 0 and it is same for all pairs, then again m can take any value, else return -1
Finally the value of m obtained must be greater than every element in the array (ai), if this is false, then return -1

 Yes
 I did that but I'll check once again
 The simplecpp files must be present in the same directory in which you are compiling
 Yes I opened the terminal in the same directory
 Replace include<simplecpp> to include<iostream >
 IMG-20210311-WA0012.jpg (file attached)
All the files in the simplecpp folder loke lib and src here must be in the directory so copy paste them from the simplecpp folder
 Things like canvas won't work then
 Canvas isnt working even using simplecpp for me anyone knows how to fix
 Yes that works
 And ```using namespace std;```
 Why you here
 Even tho I put them in the same folder using simplecpp header file it's not getting compiled
 Check if their is s++ file in /bin if not then reinstall
 S++ also is working now
 Only simplecpp header files are having this problem
 I didn't have this problem on virtual box but i am getting it on dual boot apparently the libsprite file in lib is failing to be extracted
 What IDE are you guys using on Linux?
 IMG-20210311-WA0038.jpg (file attached)
What is this error ??
 U need to be in the folder/directory in which your .cpp file is
 How did you make VM full screen
 Most prabably cd Desktop and then g++ command shall suffice
 If file is on desktop

 Else do cd foldername also

 Probably u can't do that in linux

 I also faced a similar problem
 This didn't help either
 I also faced a similar problem but then I removed the virtual box and uninstalled everything
 So ultimately changed the display settings. Any other way?
 Then?
 Same after doing what he did in the video you have to insert virtual drive again
 Watch this video
 It has a something written in description, after typing that in terminal everything works fine
 Then, again i have to add linux into virtual box
 Then this also used internet
 I removed linux from virtual box and installed it again

We must call constructors in heirarchy is it?

 if a class D inherits 2 classes, B and C, both having a function f(), then if we make instance of D(say d) and do d.f(); which one gets executed?

 Overriding is redefining new definiton to a function which is already defined in abstract or suber class
 ð
 No, normal function overriding is done at compile time
 It's not defined in A again
 It's not overriding then
 So if the definition is at the deepest level then it should executed from the child class
 ?
 Yes it is inheriting from B and C. It's not redefined in A
 Yeah, it would throw an error:"request for member g is ambiguous"

 Do last 2nd and last 4th lines mean same here?
 They do mean the same... they are printing same value also right?
 what is the meaning of *(A*)bp ?
 * (A *) bp
 It casts bp to an A pointer, then dereferences it
 for all intents and purposes, (A*)bp is of type pointer to A, so dereferencing it will also give a variable of type A, which is assigned to a2
 variable or type A or object ?
 of*
 same thing
 If A was an abstract class, we could cast bp to type A* but we cannot dereference it, right?
 You surely can
 you cannot assign it to another variable of type A tho
 bp is already a pointer to class B right ..
what will happen if we write (A*)bp ?
bp will become pointer to class A ?
 <Media omitted>
this runs correctly, and calls the derived version of foo
 you never instantiated anything
 yes.
 This message was deleted
 Here b-> foo()
(*(A *)b).foo()
(*(B *)b).foo()
gives same output right ?
 Yes
 ?
 if foo wasn't a virtual function, it would not give the same output
 it is a virtual function
 Same thing goes for reference
 which is what is happening here
 you can think of a reference as a pointer which is automatically dereferenced before you use it
 ðð»ðð»Yess....got
 In the pic she sent the reference is of type ```base``` though, right? Because function arguments are of type base
 Its like creating a pointer of type base and then assigning base b = new derived(); I think
 base *b

 Thanks a lot. Got it @919560496948 @918308824231
 ```(*b).foo()```
 assigning pointers is just assigning the memory address, no more no less
 you are not allocating any new memory, not instantiating anything, if you're simply assigning a pointer to the value of another pointer
 a pointer simply stores an address, which will be a 64 bit value on most machines (32 bit if you have an old ass system)
 thanks
 that's it
 Oh
So it does have all the memory in the address it is pointing to but we cannot access it
 Of course, this is some high level stuff and you can skip it if you don't understand it in the first fo
 go*
 Coolð¥ð¥ð¥
 that is a compile time error. The compiler has access to your definitions, and it will see that it is not syntactically valid and complain
 ð
 It is basically in the c++ standard that the members of a class will be stored contiguously in memory, in the order of declaration
 Yeah just checked. Got it
